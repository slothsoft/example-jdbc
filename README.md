JDBC Example
============

I'm trying to always learn new stuff by writing about it over at http://slothsoft.de/

Since ZIP files are a bit unflexible and somewhat annoying to handle I want to put the source code for my tutorials
in this GIT repository.

This example shows how to create a simple connection to a database using JDBC, all the while displaying some architectural best practices. Some detailed walkthrough is located there: http://slothsoft.de/en/content/accessing-database-using-jdbc
